This Maven Java Test Automation framework uses the following setup, and was written with the help of CursorAI IDE in under an hour.

* Selenium Webdriver
* Selenium Manager - for browser configuration
* TestNG - for Test management
* ExtentListener - for Reporting
* POM - page object model for clean code and structure
* OrangeHRM - application under test

The code was then fed into fine.ai and a prompt written to add more tests. Fine.ai created the PR which I manually approved, pulled and modified. Some modifications were necessary to get the tests to pass (see comments against test code).
